## Features <a name="features"></a>
- **Code Tracking[MOUSE OVER]**: Just by pointing your mouse, you can track any React component on your web page. This tool will highlight the exact location of the source code file, down to the specific line and column of the component.

In order to get the most out of React Code Finder, you'll need a command-line interface (CLI). Here are the steps:

1. **Install the CLI**: Run the command `npx react-code-finder-server` to execute the necessary CLI for React Code Finder.
2. **Launch React Code Finder**: Once you have the CLI running, you can launch React Code Finder via your Chrome browser.
3. **Start Navigating and Editing**: Navigate to the web page you wish to inspect. Now you can start tracking and directly editing the React components using the side panel editor.
